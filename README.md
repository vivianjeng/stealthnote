# StealthNote

StealthNote is a platform to anonymously post messages while proving you belong to an organization -
without revealing who you are.

We use [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) to prove that you have a valid Google Workspace account from your organization, while keeping your email address and other details private.

The messages you post cannot be &quot;easily&quot; linked to you.

Try it out at [stealthnote.xyz](https://stealthnote.xyz).

Read how it works [here](https://saleel.xyz/blog/stealthnote/).

## Compile

```sh
cd circuit
sh ./build.sh
```

## Prove

```sh
nargo execute
```

```sh
bb prove -b ./target/stealthnote_jwt.json -w ./target/stealthnote_jwt.gz -o ./target 
```
